#Heroes of Pymoli analysis

In this assignment I have attempted the Heroes of Pymoli analysis. It was easy with repetitive analysis based on different groupings, definitely a good way to practice what we learned throughout the class.


```

Three observable data trends in Heroes of Pymoli are:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.	Although there are only 14.06% female players as compared to 84.03% male players, the average total purchase per person for female players is 12% more than male players.
2.	Most of the players fall in the age group of 20-24. These players also contribute to about 50% of the total revenue.
3.	Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm and Fiery Glass Crusader not only are the best-selling but the most profitable games on the list.
