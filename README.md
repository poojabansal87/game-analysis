# Heroes of Pymoli analysis

![Fantasy](Images/Fantasy.jpg)

The activity aims at analyzing the data for a gaming company's most popular fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli. Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. 

I have used Pandas to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights. Three observable `data trends` in Heroes of Pymoli are:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

1.	Although there are only 14.06% female players as compared to 84.03% male players, the average total purchase per person for female players is 12% more than male players.
2.	Most of the players fall in the age group of 20-24. These players also contribute to about 50% of the total revenue.
3.	Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm and Fiery Glass Crusader not only are the best-selling but the most profitable games on the list.

```
